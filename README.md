hello!

Here are some instuctions to use this app called BOOKSHELF for best experience.

step 1- run 'npm start' in terminal to run the project, once you run this command you'll see react app showing in your browser.

step 2- You'll see front page of the app in which you can signup and then login to reach to the dashboard where you can see the books.

step 3- Now you must be seeing there are more than 40+ books, once you click on any book you will see description about that book, overall ratings given by people, author ,genres etc. 

step 4- Now you come back to the dashboard once again you will find a button called 'add to favourites' by clicking that you will be adding that particular book to your favourties book section so that later on you can see your favourites books.

step 5- Coming back to the dashboard itself you will see a button 'my favourites' when you click on that you will find out the books you have added to your favourites section.

That's all I tried my level best to create this app but surely I'll keep learning more as I have to polish my skills more.

Thankyou..
